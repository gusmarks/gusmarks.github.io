	<h4>Story Writing</h4>
		<p>Storytelling has always been one of my favorite creative outlets. I especially love crafting interactive narratives — 
		the kind where players shape the world as much as I do. Over the years, I’ve written a number of D&D campaigns for friends 
		and family, along with several other role‑play–style games.</p>

		<p>I get a real kick out of building worlds, weaving choices into the plot, and watching people bring those stories to life around the table.</p>

		<h4>Game mechanics</h4>
		<p>I’ve always been fascinated by the inner workings of games. Systems like D&D and Warhammer 40,000 (40K) draw me in because they’re 
		constantly evolving — new editions, new releases, and endless layers of complexity. I love diving into their rules, understanding how
		mechanics interact, and learning the deeper logic that makes each game tick. What really captivates me is how the spirit of each game is 
		woven directly into its rules. To play them well, you need more than knowledge; you need to understand the heart behind the system.</p>

		<p>The spirit of D&D is pure role-play. It thrives on imagination, character immersion, and the joy of stepping into another world entirely.</p>

		<p>The spirit of Warhammer 40K is strategy. Building a strong roster, crafting a plan of attack, and outmaneuvering your opponent 
		feels like a dynamic, ever-changing version of chess — one where every piece has a story and every decision shapes the battlefield.</p>

		<h4>Crafts</h4>
		<p>I’ve always loved working with small hand‑crafts. Crochet, sculpting, and felting give me a chance to slow down and create something
		with texture, color, and personality. There’s something grounding about shaping materials with my hands — watching a simple strand of yarn 
		or a bit of wool turn into something meaningful. These little projects let me experiment, relax, and bring a bit of creativity into everyday life.</p>

		<h4> General Fabrication Projects</h4>
		<p>To put it simply, I love tools. My garage is full of them, and I love working outside. I do almost all the repairs on my home,
		and over the years I’ve made both functional and decorative pieces for it. Honestly, I probably have too many projects — definitely more
		than I could list here.</p>

		<p>One of the projects I’m most proud of is building my own saline batteries. I also took on a job constructing a fence on the west 
		side of my property, and I recently made new tables for my home. The tables were especially fun: I coated them in a multicolored epoxy
		that makes the rooms feel more lively and playful.</p>
